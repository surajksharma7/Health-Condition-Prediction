# **Real-Time Health Monitoring System**  

## **Overview**  
The **Real-Time Health Monitoring System** is a machine learning-based application designed to continuously track and analyze vital health parameters. The system takes input from users (or IoT-enabled wearable devices) and predicts health conditions in real-time. It provides instant feedback, alerts, and recommendations to help individuals and healthcare providers take necessary actions.  

## **Features**  
- 🩺 **Health Condition Prediction** – Predicts if a person’s condition is *Normal, Mild, Severe, or Chronic* based on health inputs.  
- 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring** – Continuously tracks vital parameters like **heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, etc.**  
- 📉 **Data Preprocessing & Scaling** – Converts user inputs into a structured format suitable for ML predictions.  
- 🔥 **Machine Learning Model** – Uses **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** or other ML classifiers for accurate health predictions.  
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface** – Built using **Streamlit** for easy interaction and visualization.  
- ⚠️ **Instant Alerts** – Triggers warnings in case of abnormal health parameters.  
- 🌍 **Future Scope** – Can be integrated with **IoT sensors, AI-based analytics, and mobile health apps** for advanced monitoring.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Framework**: Streamlit (for UI)  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (SVM Classifier), NumPy, Pandas  
- **Data Processing**: StandardScaler (for feature scaling), LabelEncoder  
- **Model Storage**: Pickle (to load ML models)  

## **How It Works**  
1. **User Input:** The user enters health parameters such as temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, etc.  
2. **Data Processing:** Inputs are converted into numerical format and scaled appropriately.  
3. **Model Prediction:** The trained SVM model processes the inputs and predicts the health condition.  
4. **Output Display:** The result is displayed on the Streamlit interface, along with potential warnings.  
5. **Future Enhancements:** The system can be expanded to support **IoT integration, real-time cloud sync, and AI-driven analytics**.  

## **Installation & Setup**  
### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x
